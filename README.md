Testing area for Vulkan Gfx API on MacOS using MoltenVK

This is a playground area for me to test and learn the Vulkan API and gain some graphic programming knowledge. 

Currently from the initial commit the project can load an obj model with texture and render to the screen.

was used to get to the inital commit, but with some additonal code changes and structuring for future planning.

Future Plans is to make the project capable of rendering an entire world/level with lots of models and multiple gfx effects.

As I'm new to gfx any suggested improvements are welcome.
